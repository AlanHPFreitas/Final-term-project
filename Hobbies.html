    <h1 class="vagas">These are some of my main hobbies in my free time:</h1>

    <p class="title_soccer"> Soccer <div><img class="img_soccer" src="Logos/football.jpg" /><img class="img_soccer" src="Logos/football 2.jpg" /></div></p>
    <p class="soccer"> Football, or soccer in some countries, is a sport that pits two teams, composed of eleven players each (ten field players and a goalkeeper), against each other. The objective is to get the ball into the goal of the opposing team, respecting a series of rules. </p>
    <p class="title_bike"> Cycling <div><img class="img_bike" src="Logos/bike.jpeg" /></div></p>
    <p class="bike"> 
        Cycling is an activity that involves the repetition of a movement and uses the bicycle as a means of locomotion. Cycling can be competitive, recreational, and also practiced as a form of physical activity, both outdoors and indoors. </p>
    <p class="title_nature"> Contact with nature <div><img class="img_nature" src="Logos/Nature 1.jpeg" /><img class="img_nature" src="Logos/Nature 2.jpeg" /><img class="img_nature" src="Logos/Nature 3.jpeg" /></div></p>
    <p class="nature"> I know that not everyone likes it, but to me it should be normal in every person's life. Nature shows the beauty often hidden in simple things. From splendid places to such small animals, which attract my fascination. </p>
